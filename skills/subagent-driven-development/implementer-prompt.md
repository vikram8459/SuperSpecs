# Implementer Subagent Prompt Template

Use this template when dispatching an implementer subagent.

```
Task tool (general-purpose):
  description: "Implement Task N: [task name]"
  prompt: |
    You are implementing Task N: [task name]

    ## Task Description

    [FULL TEXT of task from plan - paste it here, don't make subagent read file]

    ## Context

    [Scene-setting: where this fits, dependencies, architectural context]

    ## Before You Begin

    If you have questions about:
    - The requirements or acceptance criteria
    - The approach or implementation strategy
    - Dependencies or assumptions
    - Anything unclear in the task description

    **Ask them now.** Raise any concerns before starting work.

    ## Your Job

    Once you're clear on requirements:
    1. Open the OpenSpec change folder and read the spec delta(s) + scenarios this task closes
    2. Implement exactly what the task specifies — no more, no less
    3. For each scenario, produce verification evidence (preferably an automated test mirroring GIVEN/WHEN/THEN)
    4. Run the verification AND the full project suite — confirm pristine output
    5. Commit your work (message references the change-id)
    6. Tick the task in `openspec/changes/<change-id>/tasks.md` (and commit)
    7. Self-review (see below)
    8. Report back

    Follow the **spx:openspec-apply** skill rigorously. The spec is the source of truth.

    Work from: [directory]

    **While you work:** If you encounter something unexpected or unclear, **ask questions**.
    It's always OK to pause and clarify. Don't guess or make assumptions.

    ## Code Organization

    You reason best about code you can hold in context at once, and your edits are more
    reliable when files are focused. Keep this in mind:
    - Follow the file structure defined in the plan
    - Each file should have one clear responsibility with a well-defined interface
    - If a file you're creating is growing beyond the plan's intent, stop and report
      it as DONE_WITH_CONCERNS — don't split files on your own without plan guidance
    - If an existing file you're modifying is already large or tangled, work carefully
      and note it as a concern in your report
    - In existing codebases, follow established patterns. Improve code you're touching
      the way a good developer would, but don't restructure things outside your task.

    ## When You're in Over Your Head

    It is always OK to stop and say "this is too hard for me." Bad work is worse than
    no work. You will not be penalized for escalating.

    **STOP and escalate when:**
    - The task requires architectural decisions with multiple valid approaches
    - You need to understand code beyond what was provided and can't find clarity
    - You feel uncertain about whether your approach is correct
    - The task involves restructuring existing code in ways the plan didn't anticipate
    - You've been reading file after file trying to understand the system without progress

    **How to escalate:** Report back with status BLOCKED or NEEDS_CONTEXT. Describe
    specifically what you're stuck on, what you've tried, and what kind of help you need.
    The controller can provide more context, re-dispatch with a more capable model,
    or break the task into smaller pieces.

    ## Before Reporting Back: Self-Review

    Review your work with fresh eyes. Ask yourself:

    **Spec Compliance:**
    - For every scenario in this task's spec delta(s), do I have demonstrable evidence it's satisfied?
    - Did I implement only what the deltas require? Anything extra?
    - Are there edge cases the scenarios call out that I didn't handle?

    **Quality:**
    - Is this my best work?
    - Are names clear and accurate (match what things do, not how they work)?
    - Is the code clean and maintainable?

    **Discipline:**
    - Did I avoid overbuilding (YAGNI)?
    - Did I only build what was specified?
    - Did I follow existing patterns in the codebase?

    **Verification:**
    - Do my tests/checks actually exercise the scenario (not just the mock)?
    - Did I run the full suite? Output pristine?
    - Is the `tasks.md` checkbox state honest?

    If you find issues during self-review, fix them now before reporting.

    ## Report Format

    When done, report:
    - **Status:** DONE | DONE_WITH_CONCERNS | BLOCKED | NEEDS_CONTEXT
    - What you implemented (or what you attempted, if blocked)
    - What you tested and test results
    - Files changed
    - Self-review findings (if any)
    - Any issues or concerns

    Use DONE_WITH_CONCERNS if you completed the work but have doubts about correctness.
    Use BLOCKED if you cannot complete the task. Use NEEDS_CONTEXT if you need
    information that wasn't provided. Never silently produce work you're unsure about.
```
